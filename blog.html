                        After several attempts over the year, I finally found my favorite ratio for a homemade Matcha Einspänner. Through 
                        many trial and errors and experimenting with different oatmilk brands and sweetening syrups, I found the perfect balance of sweetness 
                        and umaminess. <br>

                    <p class="body"> Here is a video of me trying out golfing over Summer. I have been going to the golf range with my friends, practicing my swings. I have not been consistent with 
                        this though. Playing golf with my friends at the nearest range, to me, is a good break away and a good bonding time. I have friends
                        who have taken a few lessons from professionals and having them teach me as I try to perfect my swings is fun. To this day, I am still failing
                        to be consistent with my swings; however, with time, I hope to be able to get good contact with my swings on the ball. Adjusting my hips, my swings,
                        my arms after every fail is mentally tough, though practice makes perfect is what I believe and preach. Golf is something I will
                        keep on practicing occassionally on my free times since I enjoy the break and satisfaction I get every time I see improvement.

                        My most valuable asset and passion of mines for the past 3 years have been Intraday Trading. A love and hate relationship.
                        Through years of practice, patience, and discipline, I have progressed to the point where I am now. In these markets, I am 
                        going head to head  against billion dollar firms, Quants, and banks. Each day, I clock in at 5:30am, ready to make trade decisions
                        with confidence in my edge in the market backed with historical data. 
                        <br> </br>
                        In this profession, deemed as the most mentally challenging job by many, I have not only grown skill-wise but also grown myself as person. What I have learned from this ruthless market is that it does not care about anyone
                        or anything. Every day, the market has a goal: to reach a certain price, stopping anyone who decides to go against it. I have watched others online who fail to realize this key idea,
                        get slaughtered in this market. I was one of those traders at one point...However, my ability to adapt, grow, and learn from these mistakes 
                        allowed me to reach the point where I have proven my consistency in taking valid and winning trades. I have faced plenty of days where I have taken
                        losses back to back to back. Each time I enter a trade, it is my decision and my accountability. I have learned how to manage my risk, my emotions, my executions. 
                        <br> </br>
                        After 3 years, through the lows and the highs, I am glad to say I have finally gotten to the point where I am confident in the markets and myself.              
                        This same process that I have gone through is applicable to everything every person goes through in life. Whether it is games or Computer Science or a hobby. So many people
                        get stuck in a phase where nothing is working or they are not good at it, they fail and give up. Through time and respecting the process,
                        everyone can become great at it if enough effort and determination is shown.
