                    <h2 class="center"> My Background</h2>
                    <p> I am born and raised in California, more specifically San Gabriel. My family has always been supportive
                        of my dreams and goals in the future which plays a deep role in my motivation to always do my best.
                        I love spending time outside whether it is hiking, eating, or exploring surrounding areas with my close friends, ones
                        that have stuck by my side since my early middle school years and that I genuinely appreciate. So far, my college experience
                        in Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has been very fun as I also met more and expanded my network of friends, spending
                        a lot of my time around them creating new memories. 
                        <br>
                        Right now, I’m focused on building and refining the skills to land a 
                        software engineering role in the future which will be my main job. Alongside that, 
                        I dedicate significant time to investing and trading, aiming to develop a steady side 
                        income to complement my career in computer science. My hobbies are few by choice, but they’re ones I genuinely enjoy and commit to as I believe this is the most optimal way to grow and improve in them.

                    <p> 
                        One of my favorite songs from Rod Wave is "Last Lap." It is one of Rod Wave’s standout songs, with it being the headliner of 
                        his newest album. 
                        He’s a top artist for me because his themes are very relatable. 
                        In this track, he pays tribute to his uncle, an influential figure in his life who sadly passed while grieving the loss of his two daughters. 
                        Much of his music is melodic and grounded in real-life challenges, underscoring the idea that everyone faces hardship and that, 
                        even through the lows and highs in life, you must keep going.
